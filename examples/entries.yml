# Spawn zombies more often and in large packs.
# This will update the weight/group size in all the biomes that
# minecraft:zombie was ALREADY registered to spawn in.
# You NEED to write both a 'weight' and 'group_size' for the entry to apply.
- mobs:
    minecraft: [zombie]
  weight: 2000
  group_size: [5, 10]

# Want to only update/add zombie spawns in SPECIFIC biomes? Write a 'biomes' object.
# After applying this entry, zombies will now spawn really often in the Plains and in the Nether!
- mobs:
    minecraft: [zombie]
  biomes:
    minecraft: [plains, hell]
  weight: 2000
  group_size: [5, 10]

# Want zombies to ONLY spawn in the Nether? Add 'remove: existing' to what we had before.
# This REMOVES existing biome spawns before adding our new spawn to minecraft:hell.
- mobs:
    minecraft: [zombie]
  biomes:
    minecraft: [hell]
  remove: existing
  weight: 2000
  group_size: [5, 10]

# Want to only REMOVE spawns from mobs? Don't specify 'weight' or 'group_size', only 'remove'.
# All existing biomes are removed here, so spiders will never spawn again.
- mobs:
    minecraft: [spider]
  remove: existing

# Want to only remove spawns from SPECIFIC biomes? Write 'remove: specified'.
# Creepers will no longer spawn in the desert.
- mobs:
    minecraft: [creeper]
  biomes:
    minecraft: [desert]
  remove: specified

# NOTE: It's recommended you do NOT write 'remove: specified' and 'weight'/'group_size' in the same entry.

# Here we set a very high spawn weight and group size for
# 6 mobs from 3 different mods in 3 biomes.
- mobs:
    minecraft: [spider, creeper]
    five_nights_at_freddycraft: [toychica, nightmarefredbear]
    techguns: [zombieminer, cyberdemon]
  biomes:
    minecraft: [desert, jungle, hell]
  weight: 1000
  group_size: [10, 20]

# Need to target ALL mobs or ALL biomes from a mod? Use '*'.
# This entry sets spawn weight to 1 and only allows 1 to spawn at a time
# for ALL Lycanites Mobs and ALL Much More Spiders mobs
# in ALL Minecraft biomes and ALL Biomes 'O Plenty biomes.
- mobs:
    # Match ALL mobs from certain mods by writing '*' instead of a list
    lycanitesmobs: '*'
