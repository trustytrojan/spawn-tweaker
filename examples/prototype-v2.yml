on_join:
  # the 'deny' list contains "rule" objects similar to spawn.json from "In Control!"
  # if all conditions in **one** of the rules is satisfied, the spawn is **denied**,
  # and no other rules are evaluated.
  deny:
    # this rule denies Toy Chica from spawning if there are already (1 * loaded_chunks / 289)
    # of them in the world (vanilla spawn cap logic). this is specified by ',perchunk' after the amount.
