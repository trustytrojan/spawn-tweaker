# FALSE "MOD CAP" EXAMPLES
# SRP is used for the examples but this applies to all mods.

# This rule will NOT cap all srparasites mobs to 5.
# The selector selects any SRP mob trying to spawn.
# The count condition counts for 5 of the SELECTED mob.
# For example: srparasites:buglin gets selected; if there are 5 srparasites:buglin mobs, deny; otherwise, allow.
# The same applies for any srparasites mob: srparasites:worker gets selected; if there are 5 srparasites:worker mobs, deny; otherwise, allow.
- for: { mobs: { srparasites: '*' } }
  if: { count: { at_least: 5 } }
  then: deny

# This rule is equivalent to the above rule.
- for:
    mobs: { srparasites: '*' }
    count: { at_least: 5 }
  then: deny

# This rule is equivalent to the above two rules.
- if:
    mobs: { srparasites: '*' }
    count: { at_least: 5 }
  then: deny

# If you don't understand why the above three rules are equivalent, read docs/rules.md again.

# This rule WILL cap all srparasites mobs to 5.
# Why? Because we specified to the count condition EXACTLY what to count.
# In this case, it is counting ALL srparasites mobs.
# The above examples don't do this; they let the count condition only count the mob that made it to the count condition.
- for: { mobs: { srparasites: '*' } }

      at_least: 5
