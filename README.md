# Spawn Tweaker
Spawn Tweaker is a successor to [McJtyMods/InControl](https://github.com/McJtyMods/InControl) for Forge 1.12.2, since 1.12.2 was abandoned by the developer.

Spawn Tweaker allows you to:
- Modify biome spawn entries (weights and pack/group sizes) for any mobs in any biomes
- Control mob spawns with a YAML-based rule system inspired by InControl
- Use and configure a custom natural spawning algorithm
